## 6. Usability Testing.

🐶User 1: Argued that in each view of the application, an image related to the theme should be included because the white background gave it a rather simplistic appearance. (1 user mentioned this).

🐶Users: They were asked to complete the tasks in the application and then share their opinions based on their experience. This user stated that the application was easily accessible and that the required actions were clear. (4 users agreed).

## 8. General Features.

🐶This is a Single Page Application (SPA) consisting of various views, such as the home page (Home), registration (Register), login (Login), the dog registration form (Dogform), and the feed.

🐶We utilized Firebase, a platform primarily designed to simplify web and mobile application development, enabling more efficient work without compromising the required quality.

🐶It leverages Firestore, our cloud-based NoSQL database, to store and synchronize data in a flexible and scalable manner. This facilitates development from both the client and server sides, ensuring efficient and reliable data management for the application.

## 9. Who Are the Users?

This project is aimed at dog lovers, the "best friends of humans," including dogs of all breeds and sizes.🐶🐕🐕‍🦺🐩🦮

## 10. Product Goals.

🐶The primary purpose of this product is to allow users to share their best moments with their dogs while also providing valuable information about adoptions, sterilization, and vaccinations. This information is currently available exclusively for Mexico and Chile.

## 11. Technologies Used

🐶**JavaScript:** Used to execute web functionality and display the results. 

🐶**HTML5:** Employed to render the app through a div that behaved like a node, allowing us to observe all elements created from JavaScript (inputs, buttons, text boxes, etc.).

🐶**CSS3** (_@mediaquery_): Determines the style and design of our application, including responsive design. Media queries were used in this project for designing on mobile phones, tablets, and desktop computers. 

🐶**GitHub:** This technology's utility was for storing the repository and facilitating collaborative work. 

🐶**Git:** Provided version control support. 

🐶**Node.js:** Used as the runtime environment for JavaScript. 

🐶**Jest:** Unit tests were performed using this technology, as it allowed for mocks to simulate Firebase methods and test the functions developed by the team. Additionally, it provided a report to assess code quality. 

🐶**Firebase:** Different Firebase methods were used to enable users to access the application. User registration was accomplished using _createUserWithEmailAndPassword_ and _signInWithPopup_. For the login view, _GoogleAuthProvider_ was used to allow logging in with Google credentials. Furthermore, _signInWithEmailAndPassword_ was employed for email login, and _onAuthStateChanged_ was used to monitor changes in user authentication status, with _signOut_ being used for logging out.

 🐶**Firestore:** This technology allowed us to access a real-time NoSQL document database. Our collections focused on user-generated posts, so methods like _collection_ and _addDoc_ were used. The object requested user email properties, date, and content. 

🐶**SPA (Single Page Application):** In order to provide our users with a faster browsing experience, the design was based on a Single Page Application (SPA). 

🐶**Vercel:** Utilized to deploy the application directly from GitHub.

## 12. Testing

## 13. Issues.

**General Issues**

🚨 Initially, there were issues with Firebase configuration.

🚨 There was a problem with CSS: views were being affected by responsiveness, and several elements needed to be designed. The background images did not fit correctly in the initial attempts. After reviewing Display Grid and delving deeper into responsive design, we were able to resolve it.

🚨 Problems with post duplication were encountered and resolved by adding a line in the onSnapshot function (section.innerHTML = '';).

🚨 Another issue was with the date; it was only displaying milliseconds and not the full date and time. The solution was to use this code: datePost.textContent = new Date(doc.data().date.seconds * 1000).toLocaleString(); This code was added to format the date properly.

🚨 In the tests, there was an issue where the dialog was not recognized in the delete test. To resolve this problem, we had to implement the following functions: HTMLDialogElement.prototype.showModal = jest.fn(); HTMLDialogElement.prototype.close = jest.fn().

## 14. Code Review.

🐶I consider that you work in an extremely organized manner. Your code looks clean and elegant, with specific variable declarations that are perfectly understandable thanks to the names you use. It's clear that you communicate effectively about what you are doing.
